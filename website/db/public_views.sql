-- Apply to the registry database as the database owner:
--   psql "$DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f website/db/public_views.sql
-- Then give the website role a password and use it in WEB_DATABASE_URL:
--   ALTER ROLE web_reader LOGIN PASSWORD '...';

-- The views run with the owner's rights, so web_reader can read them but not
